    "summary": "Blockchain as a digital ledger for keeping records of digital transactions\nand other information, it is secure and decentralized technology. The globally\ngrowing number of digital population every day possesses a significant threat\nto online data including the medical and patients data. After bitcoin,\nblockchain technology has emerged into a general-purpose technology with\napplications in medical industries and healthcare. Blockchain can promote\nhighly configurable openness while retaining the highest security standards for\ncritical data of medical patients. Referred to as distributed record keeping\nfor healthcare systems which makes digital assets unalterable and transparent\nvia a cryptographic hash and decentralized network. The study delves into the\nsecurity and safety improvement associated with implementing blockchain in\nAI-based healthcare systems. Blockchain-enabled AI tackles the existing issues\nrelated to security, performance efficiencies, and safety in healthcare\nsystems. We have also examined the Artificial Intelligence in healthcare and\nmedical industry, potential areas, open questions concerning the blockchain in\nhealthcare systems. Finally, the article proposed an AI-based healthcare\nblockchain model (healthAIChain) to improve patients data and security.",
