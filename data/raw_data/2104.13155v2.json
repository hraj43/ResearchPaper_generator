    "summary": "This article reviews the \"Once learning\" mechanism that was proposed 23 years\nago and the subsequent successes of \"One-shot learning\" in image classification\nand \"You Only Look Once - YOLO\" in objective detection. Analyzing the current\ndevelopment of Artificial Intelligence (AI), the proposal is that AI should be\nclearly divided into the following categories: Artificial Human Intelligence\n(AHI), Artificial Machine Intelligence (AMI), and Artificial Biological\nIntelligence (ABI), which will also be the main directions of theory and\napplication development for AI. As a watershed for the branches of AI, some\nclassification standards and methods are discussed: 1) Human-oriented,\nmachine-oriented, and biological-oriented AI R&D; 2) Information input\nprocessed by Dimensionality-up or Dimensionality-reduction; 3) The use of\none/few or large samples for knowledge learning.",
