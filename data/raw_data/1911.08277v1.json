    "summary": "In this report, the University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG) has written\ndown lessons learned on how blockchain technology can have an impact on the\nhealthcare domain. By looking at two use-cases, the hospital challenged several\nteams, participating in an open innovation program and blockchain hackathon, to\nfind a solution that showed the added value of the technology for patient care\nand scientific research. Besides this practical perspective, the report also\nconsiders literature discussing the current state of blockchain technology in\nregard to developments in the healthcare domain (touching on patient\nempowerment, data management, regulations, and interoperability between\nhealthcare systems).",
