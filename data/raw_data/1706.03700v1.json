    "summary": "Since the inception of the Bitcoin technology, its underlying data\nstructure--the blockchain--has garnered much attention due to properties such\nas decentralization, transparency, and immutability. These properties make\nblockchains suitable for apps that require disintermediation through trustless\nexchange, consistent and incorruptible transaction records, and operational\nmodels beyond cryptocurrency. In particular, blockchain and its smart contract\ncapabilities have the potential to address healthcare interoperability issues,\nsuch as enabling effective interactions between users and medical applications,\ndelivering patient data securely to a variety of organizations and devices, and\nimproving the overall efficiency of medical practice workflow. Despite the\ninterest in using blockchain for healthcare interoperability, however, little\ninformation is available on the concrete architectural styles and patterns for\napplying blockchain to healthcare apps. This paper provides an initial step in\nfilling this gap by showing: (1) the features and implementation challenges in\nhealthcare interoperability, (2) an end-to-end case study of a blockchain-based\nhealthcare app we are developing, and (3) how applying foundational software\npatterns can help address common interoperability challenges faced by\nblockchain-based healthcare apps.",
